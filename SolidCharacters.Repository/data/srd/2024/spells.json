At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range).

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below.\n**_Set the Trigger._** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n**_Explosive Rune._** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n**_Spell Glyph._** You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.\nWhen the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.

In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion to make them appear as plain sections of wall.\n**_Stairs._** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as in the *Web* spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are destroyed while *Guards and Wards* lasts.\n**_Other Spell Effect._** Place one of the following magical effects within the warded area:\n- *Dancing Lights* in four corridors, with a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *Guards and Wards* lasts\n- *Magic Mouth* in two locations\n- *Stinking Cloud* in two locations (the vapors return within 10 minutes if dispersed while *Guards and Wards* lasts)\n- *Gust of Wind* in one corridor or room (the wind blows continuously while the spell lasts)\n- *Suggestion* in one 5-foot square; any creature that enters that square receives the suggestion mentally",

For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.\nAn affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard.

If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM's choice).\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\nA task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.",

    "description": "A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point within range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the spell ends instantly without effect.\nThe wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute.\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer forces the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table.\nThe wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration. *Antimagic Field* has no effect on the wall, and *Dispel Magic* can affect only the violet layer.\nTable: Prismatic Layers\n| Order | Effects                      |\n|-------|------------------------------|\n| 1     | **Red.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Fire damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects*: Nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Cold damage. |\n| 2     | **Orange.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Acid damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* Magical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed by a strong wind (such as the one created by *Gust of Wind*). |\n| 3     | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Lightning damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 60 Force damage. |\n| 4     | **Green.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Poison damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* A *Passwall* spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. |\n| 5     | **Blue.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Cold damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Fire damage. |\n| 6     | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the Restrained condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the Petrified condition until it is freed by an effect like the *Greater Restoration* spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. *Additional Effects:* Spells can't be cast through this layer, which is destroyed by Bright Light shed by the *Daylight* spell. |\n| 7     | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the Blinded condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (GM's choice). *Additional Effects:* This layer is destroyed by *Dispel Magic*. |",

Each one is explained below.\n**_Set the Trigger._** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.\nYou can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nOnce triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\nMany major temples, guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles. Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.\nWhen you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.\nYou can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for 365 days.",

    "description": "*Wish* is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n**_Object Creation._** You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.\n**_Instant Health._** You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the *Greater Restoration* spell.\n**_Resistance._** You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.\n**_Spell Immunity._** You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.\n**_Sudden Learning._** You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.\n**_Roll Redo._** You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a *Wish* spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n**_Reshape Reality._** You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game.\nSimilarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, your wish fails.\nThe stress of casting *Wish* to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast *Wish* ever again if you suffer this stress.",
