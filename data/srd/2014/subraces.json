You can have up to three such devices active at a time.\nWhen you create a device, choose one of the following options:\nClockwork Toy: This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.\nFire Starter: The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.\nMusic Box: When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed."
